# Travel and Tourism
The travel and tourism industry is a forever chaning one as our history and discoveries continue to expand. Travelling experience and tourism can be enhanced through object recognition such as using it to recognise tourist locations or geological features to provide audio guides or information of the location through a mobile app, showing information about upcoming events in the area or history of the site; which tourist pedestrians may access through their camera feature to see if there is anything interesting in thir field of view and enhancing the immersive travelling experience. However, this may pose a safety risk as tourists might focus more on their mobile devices rather than their surroundings, and lead to dangers such as incoming cars while crossing the road. Object recognition may also benefit tourism as it can also be used to locate the tourists' location in addition to GPS, being able to identify the user's location through surrounding buildings and features and guide them to their desired location.
