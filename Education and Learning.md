# Education and Learning
Education plays an important role for future of humanity, and is therefore vital that learning efficiency improves along with out technology. Object recognition may be used for young children to learn to recognise objects themselves, teaching them names of objects in their surroundings. It could also be implemented in environments like Zoos, to show information about the animal they see and act as an encyclopedia that's interactive with the environment around them, jumping out of the pictures and pages from traditional children books. It could be also used to identify students and their location in the school, and therefore improve security apon school perimeters. Ironically this may also cause secrutiy concerns such as privacy issues, as the computer will require a large database of information of facial features of the students.
