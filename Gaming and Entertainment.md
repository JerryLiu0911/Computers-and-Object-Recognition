# Gaming and Entertainment
The gaming and entertainment industry is one that is constantly expanding day by day as more technology is implemented into the field. An example of this is VR technology, providing an immersive experience into a virtual world, however as the virtual world is not based on real space, objects in the real world aren't translated into the virtual reality, causing the player to be essentially blind to their surroudings, leading to things such as bumping into walls or nearby objects, confining them to a small space whilst in a wide virtual world waiting to be explored. Object recognition can enhchance this experience by recognising objects in the physical world and translate them into the virtual environment, breaking the barrier between reality and virtual reality. This allows players to be able to experience their physical environment within the game, redefining an "immersive game experience". However, the risks of this may cause the player to spend long periods of time in this virutal reality and lose contact with the real world.
