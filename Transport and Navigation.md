# Transport and Navigation
The efficienecy of transport and navigation is improving as technology advances, object recognition being no exception. The technology is already being implemented in automobiles to allow for auto-pilot features as it can recognise stop signs, pedestrians and traffic signal; along with the combination of gps, cars can now self-navigate to the driver's desired location without them touching the steering wheel. Apart from autopilot, object recognition can also benefit navigation systems by recognising nearby buildings and geographical features, and therefore guide the user to their desired location from where their perspective,  making a more personalised guide than the birds-eye view from a gps.
