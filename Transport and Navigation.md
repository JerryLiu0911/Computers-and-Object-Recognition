# Transport and Navigation
The efficienecy of transport and navigation is improving as technology advances, object recognition being no exception. The technology is already being implemented in automobiles to allow for auto-pilot features as it can recognise stop signs, pedestrians and traffic signal; along with the combination of gps, cars can now self-navigate to the driver's desired location without them touching the steering wheel. Apart from autopilot, object recognition can also benefit navigation systems by recognising nearby buildings and geographical features, and therefore guide the user to their desired location from where their perspective,  making a more personalised guide than the birds-eye view from a gps. It may also be implemented in places such as airports or parking lots to identify the planes and cars that are coming in and out of the area, improving efficiency in keeping track of the plane schedule or the parking times of each vehicle. However, the heavy reliance on the technology may also introduces increased risk if the system malfunctions, as large objects like planes require a camera with a wide field of view, and therfore may have a lower quality capture.
