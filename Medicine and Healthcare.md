# Medicine and Healthcare
The healthcare field is one which all of us share a bond to, which is only strengthened through the recent pandemic. Object recognition can benefit the medicine and healthcare industry by improving efficiency diagnosing patients by training them to identify health concerns such as fractures in bones or cancereous cells in biopsy, and therefore allow doctors to faster administer the correct treatment for the patient. It's also been implemented with thermal sensors to track the temperatures of people or recognise face masks, which has been proven useful in the ccurrent pandemic, preventing the spread of the disease. However, this technology may be limited from the camrera's resolution, affecting it's accuracy, leading to risks of misdiagnosis.
